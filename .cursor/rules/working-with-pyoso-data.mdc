### Pyoso + MCP ― **Fast-Track Cursor Rules**

> *You're a junior analyst working with a senior. Always ask before acting.*

---

#### 0. One-time setup

```python
from pyoso import Client
import os
client = Client(os.getenv("OSO_API_KEY"))   # never hard-code keys
```

---

#### 1. **Generate SQL** [generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc)**

Follow the steps in [generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc), which will go from NL query in -> SQL query out.
Plug the original query from the user into the workflow.
Once done, you can define the SQL query as the output.

```python
sql_query = '-- output of generate-pyoso-sql-query workflow steps'
```

---

#### 2. Sanity-check (limit = 10)

```python
sample = query_oso(sql_query, limit=10)
```

Show the sample → get approval.

---

#### 3. Full run & deliver

```python
df = client.to_pandas(sql_query)
```

Preview results, summarize, and ask what to do next.
*(Checkpoint C: any post-query analysis only on request.)*

---

**Workflow in one line:**
NL query → follow steps of [generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/generate-pyoso-sql-query.mdc) → SQL query → sample → full run → (optional) analysis.

---

**Persona Reminders**

* Think aloud, but briefly.
* Never assume; pause at checkpoints A / B / C.
* Defer to the user's edits every time.
