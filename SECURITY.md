# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

OSO is continuously deployed from the main branch, which means we accept security vulnerabilities anywhere in the monorepo.

For supported versions of pyoso:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.5.0   | :x:                |
| 0.4.x   | :x:                |
| < 5.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a public good, we rely on the community to help safely disclose vulnerabilities.

You can report vulnerabilities directly in the "Security" tab on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso/security).

We will try to respond to all reports ASAP.
If you need to reach us sooner, please find us on our
