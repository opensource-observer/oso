# Artifacts Lineage Simplification Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the current lineage of the `artifacts_by_project_v1` model and proposes a simplified structure to improve maintainability and understanding. The project includes lineage diagrams, comparisons, sample implementations, and implementation guidance.

## Files Created

1. **[artifacts_by_project_lineage.md](artifacts_by_project_lineage.md)**

   - Current lineage diagram showing all intermediate models that feed into `artifacts_by_project_v1`
   - Detailed descriptions of each model organized by dependency level
   - Note on circular dependencies that were simplified in the diagram

2. **[simplified_artifacts_by_project_lineage.md](simplified_artifacts_by_project_lineage.md)**

   - Proposed simplified lineage diagram
   - Detailed descriptions of the simplified model structure
   - Benefits of the simplified approach
   - Implementation considerations

3. **[lineage_comparison.md](lineage_comparison.md)**

   - Side-by-side comparison of current and simplified structures
   - Metrics on model count reduction and dependency level reduction
   - Detailed analysis of structural improvements
   - Proposed migration strategy

4. **Sample Implementations:**

   - **[sample_int_raw_artifacts.sql](sample_int_raw_artifacts.sql)** - Consolidated model for artifacts from all sources
   - **[sample_int_ossd_interface.sql](sample_int_ossd_interface.sql)** - Interface model for OSS Directory data
   - **[sample_int_typed_artifacts.sql](sample_int_typed_artifacts.sql)** - Unified model for all artifact types

5. **[simplified_lineage_README.md](simplified_lineage_README.md)**
   - Comprehensive guide to implementing the simplified structure
   - Core principles of the simplified approach
   - Detailed implementation strategy
   - Benefits and considerations

## Key Findings

1. **Current Structure Complexity:**

   - 18 models across 7 dependency levels
   - Circular dependencies between models
   - Separate models for different artifact types and sources
   - Complex deployment chains

2. **Simplified Structure Benefits:**

   - 50% reduction in model count (18 → 9)
   - 43% reduction in dependency levels (7 → 4)
   - Clearer unidirectional data flow
   - Easier to maintain and extend

3. **Core Principles:**
   - Source Abstraction: Clear interfaces between staging and intermediate layers
   - Type Consolidation: Single model for all artifact types with a type column
   - Domain Modularization: Group related models into clear domains

## Implementation Approach

The recommended implementation approach is phased:

1. Create interface models
2. Implement consolidated models
3. Implement domain-specific modules
4. Update final models
5. Deprecate legacy models

Each phase includes validation steps to ensure data integrity and backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

1. Review the proposed structure and sample implementations
2. Develop a detailed migration plan
3. Implement Phase 1 (interface models)
4. Validate and iterate
5. Continue with subsequent phases

## Conclusion

The simplified lineage structure offers significant advantages in terms of maintainability, clarity, and extensibility. By reducing the model count by 50% and flattening the dependency hierarchy, the lineage becomes much easier to understand and maintain.

The sample implementations and guidance provided in this project serve as a starting point for implementing the simplified structure. The phased approach ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing processes.
