## Anatomy of the semantic layer

The semantic layer provides an interface that takes a lot of inspiration from
the wonderful work at [cube.dev](https://cube.dev). Many of the same
abstractions are used to provide a similar vocabulary for those familiar with
that tool. These abstractions and components are as such:

- `Model`
  - A model is a given object abstraction in for a given data type in the OSO
    data warehouse. At this time, it is expected that there's a single
    canonical table to represent a given Model. Models, like any object can
    relate to each other. For instance, the OSO data model has the concept of
    an Artifact which is part of zero or more Projects, and Projects which are
    part of zero or more Collections. Each of those entities are related to
    their associated Models.
- `Dimension`
  - A dimension is a non-aggregated attribute of a model. This could be
    something like an Artifact name, a Project namespace, a Collection
    description, an Event type, or Event time.
- `Measure`
  - A measure is an aggregated attribute of a model that is usually used to summarize values related to a model. This could be something like, the count of Artfiacts or sum of the amount dimension of Events.
- `Relationship`
  - A relationship defines a relationship is a special attribute that defines
    the relationship between one model and another. In sql, this is modelled as
    some kind of foreign key.
- `Interface`
  - Much like an interface in an object oriented language, an interface is a generic interface that can be applied to a given model. This allows us to provide
- `Registry`
  - A registry is the directory of all the models and their relationships to
    each other. Without the registry it's impossible to create a valid sql
    query.
