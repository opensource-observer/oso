At Kariba Labs, we are on a mission to measure the impact of open source software and grow the pool of funding for public goods. We are a small team with a big vision, and we are looking for passionate individuals who are eager to make a difference. If you are someone who thrives in a dynamic, startup environment and is excited about the intersection of technology and social impact, we would love to hear from you.

## Why Work With Us?

- Be at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technology for public good, while being part of a profitable and growing business.
- Help build Open Source Observer (OSO), an open source, open data, open infrastructure tool for measuring the impact of open source software. OSO has helped deployed tens of millions of dollars to open source projects already.
- Work in a flexible (remote-friendly), dynamic (everyone ships to production every day), low-meeting environment where your contributions have a huge direct impact.
- Join an experienced team that values collaborating closely, building strong relationships, and pushing each other to grow. Many of us have worked together for years.

## We value

- Integrity: we do the right thing, even when noone is watching
- Agency: everyone is empowered to drive solutions to production, no matter your seniority. You run through walls to get things done and question when things can be better.
- Swiss-army knives: everyone wears many hats. No job is not your job.
- Superlinear effects: we strive for amazing team-work where the total is greater than the sum of its parts. If a 10-person team can only deliver 10x, we're failing.
- Missionaries over mercenaries: we believe in the power of open source innovation and growing the pie of public goods for the betterment of society. Building a strong and healthy business is just a means to that end.
