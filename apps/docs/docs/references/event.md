:::info
An **event** is a record of a transaction or other activity involving an artifact, or a snapshot of cumulative events at a given point in time. Events are used to track the history of an artifact.

## Overview

---

Every event is associated with an artifact that belongs to a single project. For example, a GitHub commit event is an event `from` a GitHub user artifact `to` a GitHub repo artifact owned by a single project. Similarly, a blockchain transaction event would be an event `from` a blockchain address artifact `to` another blockchain address artifact owned by a single project.

The `to` and `from` relationships between artifacts in an event are critical to OSO's ability to understand the impact of a project's activities and situate it in the context of overall network/ecosystem activity.

## Event Sources and Types

---

OSO tracks events from multiple sources, each with its own set of event types.

All sources of event data are associated with a unique `event_source`. We are adding new event sources all the time. The `event_source` is the same as the `artifact_source` for the artifacts the `to` and `from` artifacts in the event.

Below is a list of key event sources and their associated event types.

---

### GitHub Events (GITHUB)

GitHub events track activities related to code repositories, including commits, issues, pull requests, and more.

#### Code Events

- **COMMIT_CODE**: A commit made to a code repository
- **FORKED**: A repository being forked by a user
- **RELEASE_PUBLISHED**: Publication of a new release version
- **STARRED**: A repository being starred by a user

#### Issue Events

- **ISSUE_OPENED**: Opening of a new issue
- **ISSUE_CLOSED**: Closing of an issue
- **ISSUE_REOPENED**: Reopening of a previously closed issue
- **ISSUE_COMMENT**: A comment made on an issue

#### Pull Request Events

- **PULL_REQUEST_OPENED**: Opening of a new pull request
- **PULL_REQUEST_CLOSED**: Closing of a pull request
- **PULL_REQUEST_MERGED**: Merging of a pull request into the main branch
- **PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED**: Reopening of a previously closed pull request
- **PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW_COMMENT**: A comment made during pull request review

#### Derived Metrics

- **Commit Frequency**: Number of commits per day/week/month
- **Contributor Activity**: Number of unique contributors over time
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time to close issues
- **Pull Request Merge Rate**: Percentage of pull requests that get merged
- **Repository Engagement**: Combined score of stars, forks, and watchers

### Blockchain Events

Blockchain events track on-chain activities, including contract invocations and transactions. The `event_source` is the name of the blockchain, eg, `OPTIMISM`, `BASE`, `ARBITRUM_ONE`, etc.

#### Contract Events

- **CONTRACT_INVOCATION**: Direct invocation of a contract
- **CONTRACT_INTERNAL_INVOCATION**: Internal contract calls

#### Derived Metrics

- **Contract Usage**: Number of contract invocations per day
- **Gas Usage**: Total gas consumed by contract interactions
- **Transaction Volume**: Number of transactions involving a contract
- **User Base**: Number of unique addresses interacting with a contract over a given time period

### ERC-4337 Events (4337)

ERC-4337 events track account abstraction activities on the blockchain.

#### User Operation Events

- **CONTRACT_INVOCATION_VIA_USEROP**: Contract invocation through a user operation
- **CONTRACT_INVOCATION_VIA_PAYMASTER**: Contract invocation through a paymaster
- **CONTRACT_INVOCATION_VIA_BUNDLER**: Contract invocation through a bundler

#### Derived Metrics

- **User Operation Volume**: Number of user operations per day
- **Paymaster Usage**: Percentage of operations using paymasters
- **Bundler Distribution**: Distribution of operations across bundlers

### Funding Events (FUNDING)

Funding events track financial transactions related to open source projects.

#### Financial Events

- **GRANT_RECEIVED_USD**: Receipt of a grant in USD equivalent
- **CREDIT**: Incoming financial transaction (Open Collective)
- **DEBIT**: Outgoing financial transaction (Open Collective)

#### Derived Metrics

- **Funding Volume**: Total funding received over time
- **Funding Sources**: Distribution of funding by source
- **Expense Categories**: Breakdown of expenses by category
- **Funding Sustainability**: Ratio of incoming to outgoing funds

### Dependency Events (DEPS_DEV)

Dependency events track package dependencies and their changes.

#### Dependency Events

- **ADD_DEPENDENCY**: Addition of a new dependency
- **REMOVE_DEPENDENCY**: Removal of an existing dependency
- **DOWNLOADS**: Number of package downloads on a given date

#### Derived Metrics

- **Dependency Growth**: Rate of dependency addition over time
- **Dependency Churn**: Rate of dependency changes
- **Package Popularity**: Download trends over time
- **Dependency Health**: Ratio of active to deprecated dependencies

## Event Schema

---

All events in OSO follow a consistent schema with the following key fields:

| Field                     | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time`                    | Timestamp of the event                                  |
| `to_artifact_id`          | ID of the target artifact                               |
| `from_artifact_id`        | ID of the source artifact                               |
| `event_type`              | Type of event (e.g., COMMIT_CODE, CONTRACT_INVOCATION)  |
| `event_source_id`         | Unique identifier for the event source                  |
| `event_source`            | Source of the event (e.g., GITHUB, BLOCKCHAIN)          |
| `to_artifact_name`        | Name of the target artifact                             |

## Using Events for Analysis with pyoso

---

Events form the foundation for many OSO metrics and analyses. Raw and processed event data is available to the community via pyoso.

Here are examples of how to use pyoso to access event data:

### GitHub Events Example

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pyoso import Client

OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)

# Find the number of unique contributors to a specific repository
query = """
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT from_artifact_name) as unique_contributors
FROM int_events__github
WHERE
  event_source = 'GITHUB'
  AND to_artifact_namespace = 'ethereum'
  AND to_artifact_name = 'go-ethereum'
  AND time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)
print(f"Number of unique contributors in the last 30 days: {df['unique_contributors'].iloc[0]}")

# Get daily commit counts
query = """
SELECT
  DATE(time) as day,
  COUNT(*) as commit_count
FROM int_events__github
WHERE
  event_source = 'GITHUB'
  AND event_type = 'COMMIT_CODE'
  AND to_artifact_namespace = 'ethereum'
  AND to_artifact_name = 'go-ethereum'
  AND time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY DATE(time)
ORDER BY day
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)
print("\nDaily commit counts:")
print(df)
```

### Blockchain Events Example

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pyoso import Client

OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)

# Find the number of transactions for a specific contract on Optimism
query = """
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT from_artifact_name) as unique_users
FROM int_events__blockchain
WHERE
  event_source = 'OPTIMISM'
  AND event_type = 'CONTRACT_INVOCATION'
  AND to_artifact_name = '0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006'  -- WETH contract on Optimism
  AND time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)
print(f"Number of transactions in the last 7 days: {df['transaction_count'].iloc[0]}")
print(f"Number of unique users: {df['unique_users'].iloc[0]}")

# Get daily transaction counts
query = """
SELECT
  DATE(time) as day,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count
FROM int_events__blockchain
WHERE
  event_source = 'OPTIMISM'
  AND event_type = 'CONTRACT_INVOCATION'
  AND to_artifact_name = '0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006'
  AND time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY
GROUP BY DATE(time)
ORDER BY day
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)
print("\nDaily transaction counts:")
print(df)
```
