# Protocol Labs Network

The Protocol Labs Network (PLN) is a collection of projects contributing to the decentralized web. It includes Filecoin, IPFS, libp2p, and many more.

## Coverage on Open Source Observer

Open Source Observer currently has 38 open source projects that are part of the PLN. Project data does not yet include Filecoin or FVM addresses.

The main sources of project data come from the PL directory and any grants that have been awarded to projects from other ecosystems.
