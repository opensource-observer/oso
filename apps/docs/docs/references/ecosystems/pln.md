# Protocol Labs Network

The Protocol Labs Network (PLN) is a collection of projects contributing to the decentralized web. It includes Filecoin, IPFS, libp2p, and many more.

## Coverage on Open Source Observer

The main sources of project data come from the PL directory and any grants that have been awarded to projects from other ecosystems.
