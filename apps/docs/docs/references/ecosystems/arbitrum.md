# Arbitrum (Arbitrum One)

Arbitrum One is an EVM-equivalent Optimistic Rollup chain. It inherits Ethereum-level security, but transactions will be cheaper and faster.

## Coverage on Open Source Observer

Open Source Observer is in the process of adding open source projects that are building on Arbitrum One. Project data will include Arbitrum addresses associated with smart contracts, deployers, and grant wallets.

The main sources of project data come from
[STIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131),
[Stylus sprint](https://blog.arbitrum.io/stylus-sprint/),
other grant programs, and the Dune contracts library.

## Ecosystem Resources
