# Arbitrum (Arbitrum One)

Arbitrum One is an EVM-equivalent Optimistic Rollup chain. It inherits Ethereum-level security, but transactions will be cheaper and faster.

## Coverage on Open Source Observer

Open Source Observer is in the process of adding the first collection of open source projects that are building on Arbitrum One. Project data will include Arbitrum addresses associated with smart contracts, deployers, and grant wallets.

The main sources of project data come from [STIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131), grant programs, and the Dune contracts library.

We will be releasing our first version of Arbitrum One coverage in the coming weeks.

## Ecosystem Resources

The primary GitHub repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs).

The primary block explorer for Arbitrum One is available on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/).
