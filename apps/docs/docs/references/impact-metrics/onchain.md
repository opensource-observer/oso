# Onchain

:::info
Onchain metrics include projects' smart contracts, transaction volumes, and sequencer fee contribution. Onchain metrics are typically queried by project (e.g., `uniswap`) and network (e.g., `OPTIMISM`), but they can also be queried by contract address (e.g., `0x123...`) and even across networks (e.g., `OPTIMISM` and `BASE`).
