# Step 1: User inputs a contract address (and chain location)

```python
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5'
CHAIN_NAME = 'OPTIMISM'
```

# Step 2: Check if the contract is associated with any known projects in OSO or Atlas

```python
result = client.to_pandas(f"""
  SELECT
    abp.artifact_id,
    p.project_source,
    p.project_id,
    p.project_name,
    p.display_name

  JOIN projects_v1 AS p ON abp.project_id = p.project_id
  WHERE
    abp.artifact_name = LOWER('{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}')
    AND abp.artifact_source = UPPER('{CHAIN_NAME}')
""")
result
```

```python
if not result.empty:
    ARTIFACT_ID = result['artifact_id'].values[0]
ARTIFACT_ID

# Step 3: Check if the contract has sufficient activity to qualify for the onchain builder round

Warning: this is current a VERY LARGE table and may take a few minutes to process.

```python

END_DATE = '2025-06-01'
```

```python
metrics = client.to_pandas(f"""
  SELECT
    SUM(tm.amount) AS transaction_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tm.sample_date) AS active_days
  FROM timeseries_metrics_by_artifact_v0 AS tm
  JOIN metrics_v0 AS m ON tm.metric_id = m.metric_id
  WHERE
    m.metric_name = '{CHAIN_NAME}_contract_invocations_daily'
    AND tm.artifact_id = '{ARTIFACT_ID}'
    AND tm.sample_date BETWEEN DATE('{START_DATE}') AND DATE('{END_DATE}')
""")
metrics
```

```python
TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD = 1000
ACTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 10
if metrics['transaction_count'].max() >= TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD and metrics['active_days'].max() >= ACTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD:
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

# Step 4: Look up expected deployer

```python
contract = client.to_pandas(f"""

  SELECT *
  FROM contracts_v0
  WHERE
    contract_address = '{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}'
    AND contract_namespace = '{CHAIN_NAME}'

""")
contract.T
```

```python
if not contract.empty:
    print("Project can claim this contract by verifying ownership of deployer address", contract['root_deployer_address'].values[0])
```
