:::tip
This tutorial uses the Superchain 4337 data models which track ERC-4337 Account Abstraction activity across all Superchain networks including Base, Optimism, World, and more.
:::

## Getting Started

Before running any analysis, you'll need to set up your environment:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from pyoso import Client

# Set up the OSO client
OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)
```

For more details on setting up Python notebooks, see our guide on [writing Python notebooks](../../guides/notebooks/index.mdx).

## Step 1: Explore the Data Models

Let's start by examining the available Account Abstraction data models to understand what we're working with.

### 4337 Traces Data

The `stg_superchain__4337_traces` table contains detailed information about each user operation:

```python
# Preview the 4337 trace data
df_traces = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT *
FROM stg_superchain__4337_traces
ORDER BY block_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5
""")

print("4337 Traces Data Structure:")
print(df_traces.columns.tolist())
print("\nSample Data:")
print(df_traces)
```

This table includes:
- **chain**: The Superchain network (Base, Optimism, Zora, etc.)
- **block_timestamp**: When the operation occurred
- **transaction_hash**: The transaction that included the user operation
- **userop_hash**: Unique identifier for the user operation
- **method_id**: The method being called (0x7bb37428 for handleOps)
- **from_address**: The sender address
- **to_address**: The target contract address
- **bundler_address**: The bundler that included the operation
- **paymaster_address**: The paymaster contract (if used)
- **userop_gas_cost**: Total gas cost for the operation
- **userop_gas_used**: Gas units consumed
- **value**: ETH value transferred (usually 0 for AA operations)

### 4337 User Operation Logs

The `stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs` table contains event logs from user operations:

```python
# Preview the 4337 logs data
df_logs = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT *
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
ORDER BY block_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5
""")

print("4337 Logs Data Structure:")
print(df_logs.columns.tolist())
print("\nSample Data:")
print(df_logs)
```

This table includes:
- **sender_address**: The account that initiated the operation
- **paymaster_address**: The paymaster used (if any)
- **contract_address**: The EntryPoint contract address
- **userop_gas_price**: Gas price for the operation
- **userop_gas_used**: Gas units consumed

### Address Labels

We can also explored labeled addresses from the [Open Labels Initiative](https://www.openlabelsinitiative.org/):

```python
# Preview the address labels data
df_labels = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT * 
FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
LIMIT 5
""")

print("Address Labels Data Structure:")
print(df_labels.columns.tolist())
print("\nSample Data:")
print(df_labels)
```

This table contains labels for addresses, including:
- **address**: The address that the label is assigned to
- **tag_id**: The type of label (e.g. "is_paymaster", "owner_project")
- **tag_value**: The value of the label (e.g. "Alchemy", "Pimlico")


## Step 2: Analyze Paymaster Usage

Paymasters are a key component of Account Abstraction that allows an operator to pay for gas on behalf of a user. Let's analyze which paymasters are most popular, using the labels curated by 0xKofi at [BundleBear](https://www.bundlebear.com/)

### Identify Known Paymasters

First, let's identify paymasters that have been labeled:

```python
# Get known paymasters with their project owners
df_known_paymasters = client.to_pandas("""
WITH paymasters AS (
  SELECT address
  FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
  WHERE tag_id = 'is_paymaster'
)
SELECT
  address,
  MIN(tag_value) AS owner_project
FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
WHERE
  tag_id = 'owner_project'
  AND address IN (SELECT address FROM paymasters)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY owner_project
""")

print("Known Paymasters by Project:")
print(df_known_paymasters.groupby('owner_project')['address'].nunique().sort_values(ascending=False))
```

### Analyze Paymaster Usage Over Time

Now let's analyze how paymaster usage has evolved across different chains:

```python
# Get daily paymaster usage by project and chain
df_paymaster_usage = client.to_pandas("""
WITH paymasters AS (
  SELECT address
  FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
  WHERE tag_id = 'is_paymaster'
),
labeled_paymasters AS (
  SELECT
    address,
    MIN(tag_value) AS owner_project
  FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
  WHERE
    tag_id = 'owner_project'
    AND address IN (SELECT address FROM paymasters)
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('DAY', block_timestamp) AS bucket_day,
  COALESCE(p.owner_project, 'unknown') AS owner_project,
  chain,
  COUNT(*) AS userops_count
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs AS logs
LEFT JOIN labeled_paymasters AS p ON logs.paymaster_address = p.address
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY bucket_day DESC, userops_count DESC
""")

# Convert to datetime for plotting
df_paymaster_usage['bucket_day'] = pd.to_datetime(df_paymaster_usage['bucket_day'])
```

### Visualize Paymaster Usage

Let's create visualizations to understand the trends:

```python
# Plot paymaster usage over time
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

# Pivot data for plotting
pivot_data = df_paymaster_usage.pivot_table(
    index='bucket_day',
    columns='owner_project',
    values='userops_count',
    aggfunc='sum',
    fill_value=0
)

# Plot with area chart
ax = pivot_data.plot(
    kind='area',
    stacked=True,
    title='Account Abstraction UserOps by Paymaster Project',
    figsize=(20, 10)
)

# Format x-axis
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.MonthLocator(interval=1))
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%b %Y'))
ax.set_xlim(pd.to_datetime('2024-10-01'), pd.to_datetime('2025-07-01'))
ax.legend(frameon=True, loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
ax.set_ylabel('Daily User Operations')
ax.set_xlabel('Date')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Step 3: Chain-by-Chain Analysis

Let's analyze Account Abstraction activity across different Superchain networks.

### Total Activity by Chain

```python
# Get total activity by chain
df_chain_totals = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT
  chain,
  COUNT(*) AS total_userops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sender_address) AS unique_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT paymaster_address) AS unique_paymasters,
  AVG(userop_gas_used) AS avg_gas_used,
  SUM(userop_gas_used * userop_gas_price) / 1e18 AS total_gas_cost_eth
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
WHERE paymaster_address != '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
GROUP BY chain
ORDER BY total_userops DESC
""")

print("Account Abstraction Activity by Chain:")
print(df_chain_totals)
```

### Daily Activity Trends by Chain

```python
# Get daily activity by chain
df_daily_by_chain = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('DAY', block_timestamp) AS bucket_day,
  chain,
  COUNT(*) AS userops_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sender_address) AS unique_users
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY bucket_day DESC, userops_count DESC
""")

df_daily_by_chain['bucket_day'] = pd.to_datetime(df_daily_by_chain['bucket_day'])

# Plot daily activity by chain
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

pivot_chain = df_daily_by_chain.pivot_table(
    index='bucket_day',
    columns='chain',
    values='userops_count',
    aggfunc='sum',
    fill_value=0
)

ax = pivot_chain.plot(
    kind='area',
    title='Account Abstraction UserOps by Chain',
    figsize=(20, 10)
)

ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.MonthLocator(interval=1))
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%b %Y'))
ax.set_xlim(pd.to_datetime('2024-10-01'), pd.to_datetime('2025-07-01'))
ax.legend(frameon=True, loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
ax.set_ylabel('Daily User Operations')
ax.set_xlabel('Date')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

![Daily Activity Trends by Chain](./aa-by-chain-all.png)

We can see that the number of user operations has been increasing over time, with a surge in activity in March 2025 from World. If we remove World from the analysis, we still see steady growth in activity.

## Step 4: User Behavior Analysis

Let's analyze user behavior patterns in Account Abstraction.

### User Activity Distribution

```python
# Analyze user activity distribution
df_user_activity = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT
  sender_address,
  chain,
  COUNT(*) AS userops_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', block_timestamp)) AS active_days,
  MIN(block_timestamp) AS first_activity,
  MAX(block_timestamp) AS last_activity,
  AVG(userop_gas_used) AS avg_gas_used
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY userops_count DESC
LIMIT 100
""")

print("Top Users by Activity:")
print(df_user_activity.head(10))
```

### Paymaster Adoption Analysis

```python
# Analyze paymaster adoption patterns
df_paymaster_adoption = client.to_pandas("""
WITH paymasters AS (
  SELECT address
  FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
  WHERE tag_id = 'is_paymaster'
),
labeled_paymasters AS (
  SELECT
    address,
    MIN(tag_value) AS owner_project
  FROM stg_openlabelsinitiative__labels_decoded
  WHERE
    tag_id = 'owner_project'
    AND address IN (SELECT address FROM paymasters)
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
  COALESCE(p.owner_project, 'unknown') AS paymaster_project,
  chain,
  COUNT(*) AS total_userops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sender_address) AS unique_users,
  COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT sender_address) AS avg_userops_per_user
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs AS logs
LEFT JOIN labeled_paymasters AS p ON logs.paymaster_address = p.address
WHERE logs.paymaster_address != '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100  -- Filter for significant usage
ORDER BY total_userops DESC
""")

print("Paymaster Adoption by Chain:")
print(df_paymaster_adoption)
```

## Step 5: Gas Analysis

Let's analyze gas usage patterns in Account Abstraction operations.

### Gas Usage Trends

```python
# Analyze gas usage over time
df_gas_analysis = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('DAY', block_timestamp) AS bucket_day,
  chain,
  AVG(userop_gas_used) AS avg_gas_used,
  APPROX_PERCENTILE(userop_gas_used, 0.5) AS median_gas_used,
  APPROX_PERCENTILE(userop_gas_used, 0.95) AS p95_gas_used,
  COUNT(*) AS userops_count
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY bucket_day DESC
""")

df_gas_analysis['bucket_day'] = pd.to_datetime(df_gas_analysis['bucket_day'])

# Plot gas usage trends
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

# Focus on major chains
major_chains = ['BASE', 'OPTIMISM', 'WORLDCHAIN']
for chain in major_chains:
    chain_data = df_gas_analysis[df_gas_analysis['chain'] == chain]
    if not chain_data.empty:
        plt.plot(chain_data['bucket_day'], chain_data['avg_gas_used'], 
                label=f'{chain} - Avg Gas', linewidth=2)

plt.title('Average Gas Usage by Chain Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Gas Units')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Gas Cost Analysis

```python
# Analyze gas costs
df_gas_costs = client.to_pandas("""
SELECT
  chain,
  AVG(userop_gas_price) / 1e9 AS avg_gas_price_gwei,
  AVG(userop_gas_used * userop_gas_price) / 1e18 AS avg_gas_cost_eth,
  MEDIAN(userop_gas_used * userop_gas_price) / 1e18 AS median_gas_cost_eth,
  COUNT(*) AS userops_count
FROM stg_superchain__4337_userop_logs
WHERE userop_gas_price > 0
GROUP BY chain
ORDER BY avg_gas_cost_eth DESC
""")

print("Gas Cost Analysis by Chain:")
print(df_gas_costs)
```
