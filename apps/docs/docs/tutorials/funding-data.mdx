Analyze the funding history of your favorite projects.
New to OSO? Check out our [Getting Started guide](../get-started/index.md)
to set up your API access.

This tutorial shows how to quickly lookup the funding history of your favorite projects, and then explore funding from specific sources (e.g. Gitcoin Grants, Open Collective, etc.)

## Getting Started

Before running any analysis, you'll need to set up your environment:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

Start your Python notebook with the following:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pyoso import Client

OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)
```

For more details on setting up Python notebooks, see our guide on [writing Python notebooks](../guides/notebooks/index.mdx).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

The following queries should work if you copy-paste them into our [GraphQL sandbox](https://www.opensource.observer/graphql). For more information on how to use the GraphQL API, check out our [GraphQL guide](../integrate/api.md).

## Basic Funding Analysis

### Project Funding History

Get the complete funding history for a specific project:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
query = """
SELECT
  time,
  event_source,
  from_project_name as funder,
  amount,
  grant_pool_name
FROM oss_funding_v0
WHERE to_project_name = 'uniswap'
ORDER BY time DESC
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)

# Optional: Display total funding by source
print("Funding by source:")
print(df.groupby('event_source')['amount'].sum())
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query ProjectFundingHistory {
  oso_ossFundingV0(
    where: { toProjectName: { _eq: "uniswap" } }
    order_by: { time: desc }
  ) {
    time
    eventSource
    fromProjectName
    amount
    grantPoolName
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Top Funded Projects

Find the projects that have received the most funding:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
query = """
SELECT
  to_project_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_source) as funding_sources,
  COUNT(*) as number_of_grants,
  SUM(amount) as total_funding
FROM oss_funding_v0
GROUP BY to_project_name
HAVING total_funding > 0
ORDER BY total_funding DESC
LIMIT 20
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)

# Optional: Create a bar chart
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.bar(df, 
    x='to_project_name', 
    y='total_funding',
    title='Top Funded Projects'
)
fig.show()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query TopFundedProjects {
  # This query requires aggregation which is complex in GraphQL
  # You would need to fetch all funding data and aggregate client-side
  oso_ossFundingV0(
    limit: 1000
    order_by: { amount: desc }
  ) {
    toProjectName
    eventSource
    amount
  }
}
```

Note: For aggregation queries like this, the Python approach is more efficient as it handles the grouping and calculations server-side.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Analysis

### Funding vs Development Activity

Compare funding with development metrics to understand the relationship between financial support and project activity:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
query = """
WITH project_funding AS (
  SELECT
    to_project_name,
    SUM(amount) as total_funding,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_source) as funding_sources
  FROM oss_funding_v0
  GROUP BY to_project_name
)
SELECT
  f.to_project_name,
  f.total_funding,
  f.funding_sources,
  m.active_developer_count_6_months,
  m.commit_count_6_months,
  m.opened_issue_count_6_months,
  m.star_count,
  m.fork_count
FROM project_funding f
JOIN code_metrics_by_project_v1 m
  ON f.to_project_name = m.project_name
WHERE f.total_funding > 0
ORDER BY f.total_funding DESC
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)

# Optional: Create a scatter plot
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter(df, 
    x='total_funding', 
    y='commit_count_6_months',
    size='active_developer_count_6_months',
    hover_data=['to_project_name', 'funding_sources'],
    title='Funding vs Development Activity'
)
fig.show()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query FundingVsDevelopmentActivity {
  # This complex analysis requires multiple queries and client-side processing
  # First get code metrics for projects
  codeMetrics: oso_codeMetricsByProjectV1 {
    projectName
    activeDevCount6Months: activeDevCount6Months
    commitCount6Months
    openedIssueCount6Months
    starCount
    forkCount
  }
  
  # Then get funding data
  # You would need to fetch all funding data and aggregate client-side
  fundingData: oso_ossFundingV0 {
    toProjectName
    eventSource
    amount
  }
}
```

Note: For complex analyses like this, the Python approach is more efficient as it handles the joins and calculations server-side.

### Funding Source Analysis

Analyze the distribution and impact of different funding sources:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
query = """
SELECT
  event_source,
  grant_pool_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT to_project_name) as projects_funded,
  COUNT(*) as number_of_grants,
  SUM(amount) as total_funding,
  AVG(amount) as average_grant
FROM oss_funding_v0
GROUP BY event_source, grant_pool_name
HAVING total_funding > 0
ORDER BY total_funding DESC
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)

# Optional: Create a treemap visualization
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.treemap(df, 
    path=[px.Constant('All Sources'), 'event_source', 'grant_pool_name'],
    values='total_funding',
    title='Funding Distribution by Source'
)
fig.show()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query FundingSourceAnalysis {
  # This aggregation query requires client-side processing
  oso_ossFundingV0(
    limit: 1000
  ) {
    eventSource
    grantPoolName
    toProjectName
    amount
  }
}
```

Note: For aggregation queries like this, the Python approach is more efficient as it handles the grouping and calculations server-side.

### Social Network Funding Analysis

Analyze funding patterns within social networks by combining funding data with social graph data:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT
  donations.donor_address,
  users.user_source_id as fid,
  users.user_name as username,
  donations.project_name,
  amount_in_usd,
  timestamp
FROM gitcoin.all_donations as donations
JOIN artifacts_by_user_v1 as users
  ON lower(donations.donor_address) = users.artifact_name
WHERE
  user_source = 'FARCASTER'
  AND users.user_source_id IN (
    WITH max_date AS (
      SELECT max(date) as last_date
      FROM karma3.localtrust
    )
    SELECT CAST(j as string) as fid
    FROM karma3.localtrust
    WHERE i = 5650  -- Replace with your FID to see your network
    ORDER BY v DESC
    LIMIT 150
  )
ORDER BY amount_in_usd DESC
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)

# Optional: Create a network visualization
import networkx as nx
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Create a graph of donors and projects
G = nx.Graph()
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['username'], row['project_name'], weight=row['amount_in_usd'])

# Create a spring layout
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Create edges trace
edge_x = []
edge_y = []
for edge in G.edges():
    x0, y0 = pos[edge[0]]
    x1, y1 = pos[edge[1]]
    edge_x.extend([x0, x1, None])
    edge_y.extend([y0, y1, None])

edges_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=edge_x, y=edge_y,
    line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
    hoverinfo='none',
    mode='lines')

# Create nodes trace
node_x = []
node_y = []
node_text = []
for node in G.nodes():
    x, y = pos[node]
    node_x.append(x)
    node_y.append(y)
    node_text.append(node)

nodes_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=node_x, y=node_y,
    mode='markers+text',
    hoverinfo='text',
    text=node_text,
    textposition="top center",
    marker=dict(size=10)

# Create the figure
fig = go.Figure(data=[edges_trace, nodes_trace],
    layout=go.Layout(
        showlegend=False,
        hovermode='closest',
        margin=dict(b=0,l=0,r=0,t=0),
        xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
        yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False)
    )
)
fig.show()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query SocialNetworkFundingAnalysis {
  # This complex analysis requires multiple data sources and client-side processing
  # The Python approach is recommended for this type of analysis
  
  # You would need to query artifacts by user
  users: oso_artifactsByUserV1(
    where: { userSource: { _eq: "FARCASTER" } }
    limit: 100
  ) {
    userSourceId
    userName
    artifactName
  }
  
  # Then join with donation data from other sources
  # This would require additional queries and client-side processing
}
```

Note: For complex analyses involving multiple data sources like this, the Python approach is more efficient and flexible.
