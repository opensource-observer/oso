This tutorial shows how to:
- Check if a contract is associated with known projects in OSO or Atlas
- Analyze contract activity metrics to determine funding eligibility
- Look up contract deployment information for ownership verification

## Getting Started

Before running any analysis, you'll need to set up your environment:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from pyoso import Client

load_dotenv()
OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)
```

For more details on setting up Python notebooks, see our guide on [writing Python notebooks](../guides/notebooks/index.mdx).

## Step 1: Define the Contract to Analyze

Start by specifying the contract address and chain you want to analyze:

```python
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5'
CHAIN_NAME = 'OPTIMISM'
```

This example uses a contract on Optimism, but you can analyze contracts on any supported chain.

## Step 2: Check Project Association

First, let's check if this contract is already associated with any known projects in OSO or Atlas. This helps identify if the contract is part of an existing project ecosystem:

```python
result = client.to_pandas(f"""
  SELECT
    abp.artifact_id,
    p.project_source,
    p.project_id,
    p.project_name,
    p.display_name
  FROM artifacts_by_project_v1 AS abp
  JOIN projects_v1 AS p ON abp.project_id = p.project_id
  WHERE
    abp.artifact_name = LOWER('{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}')
    AND abp.artifact_source = UPPER('{CHAIN_NAME}')
""")
result
```

This query returns:
- **artifact_id**: Unique identifier for the contract
- **project_source**: Where the project is registered (e.g., OP_ATLAS, GITHUB)
- **project_id**: Internal project identifier
- **project_name**: Technical name of the project
- **display_name**: Human-readable project name

If the contract is associated with a project, we can extract the artifact ID for further analysis:

```python
if not result.empty:
    ARTIFACT_ID = result['artifact_id'].values[0]
ARTIFACT_ID
```

    'R/4j0CBAMP7Y6IWPuKfXET2QZWa8hgQ2I/FN+XQd2UI='

## Step 3: Analyze Contract Activity

Now let's check if the contract has sufficient activity to qualify for funding programs. This analysis uses timeseries metrics to evaluate contract usage over time:

:::warning
This query accesses a large dataset and may take a few minutes to process.
:::

```python
START_DATE = '2024-12-01'
END_DATE = '2025-06-01'
```

```python
metrics = client.to_pandas(f"""
  SELECT
    SUM(tm.amount) AS transaction_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tm.sample_date) AS active_days
  FROM timeseries_metrics_by_artifact_v0 AS tm
  JOIN metrics_v0 AS m ON tm.metric_id = m.metric_id
  WHERE
    m.metric_name = '{CHAIN_NAME}_contract_invocations_daily'
    AND tm.artifact_id = '{ARTIFACT_ID}'
    AND tm.sample_date BETWEEN DATE('{START_DATE}') AND DATE('{END_DATE}')
""")
metrics
```

This query calculates:
- **transaction_count**: Total number of contract invocations in the period
- **active_days**: Number of unique days with activity

Now let's evaluate if the contract meets typical funding eligibility criteria:

```python
TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD = 1000
ACTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 10

if metrics['transaction_count'].max() >= TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD and metrics['active_days'].max() >= ACTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD:
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

    Eligible

## Step 4: Look Up Contract Deployment Information

Finally, let's retrieve the contract's deployment information to understand ownership and verification requirements:

```python
contract = client.to_pandas(f"""
  SELECT *
  FROM contracts_v0
  WHERE
    contract_address = '{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}'
    AND contract_namespace = '{CHAIN_NAME}'
""")
contract.T
```

This query returns comprehensive contract metadata including:
- **contract_address**: The contract's address
- **root_deployer_address**: The address that deployed the contract
- **deployment_block**: Block number when contract was deployed
- **contract_namespace**: The blockchain network

If the contract exists in our database, we can identify the deployer for ownership verification:

```python
if not contract.empty:
    print("Project can claim this contract by verifying ownership of deployer address", contract['root_deployer_address'].values[0])
```

    Project can claim this contract by verifying ownership of deployer address 0xadef586efb3287da4d7d1cbe15f12e0be69e0df0

## Next Steps

- **Extend the analysis window**: Modify the date range to analyze longer periods
- **Compare multiple contracts**: Run this analysis across multiple contracts to identify patterns
- **Add gas fee analysis**: Include gas consumption metrics to understand economic impact
- **Cross-reference with funding data**: Correlate contract activity with funding received
