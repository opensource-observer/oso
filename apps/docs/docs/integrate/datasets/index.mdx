These are the final product from the data pipeline,
which is served from our [API](../api.md).

For example, you can get a list of oss-directory projects

```sql
SELECT
  project_id,
  project_name,
  display_name,
  description
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.projects_v1` LIMIT 10
```

or all contracts on Base deployed on 2025-01-01.

```sql
SELECT count(*) as cnt
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.contracts_v0`
WHERE contract_namespace = 'BASE' AND deployment_date = '2025-01-01'
```

_Note: Unless the model name is versioned with a `v1` or higher, expect that the model is unstable and should not be depended on
in a live production application._

Some of our most popular v1 models include:

- `projects_v1`: a list of all projects in the OSO data pipeline
- `artifacts_by_project_v1`: a list of all artifacts owned by a given project
- `projects_by_collection_v1`: a list of all projects in a given collection

Some of the v0 (WIP) models that we include in analysis but may be a bit unstable:

- `contracts_v0`: a list of all discovered contracts, downstream from their deployers and/or factories
- `metrics_v0`: a list of all metrics available in OSO
- `timeseries_metrics_by_project_v0`: a list of all metrics for a given project

- [Updated hourly](https://github.com/igrigorik/gharchive.org/blob/master/bigquery/README.md)

GitHub data is predominantly provided by the incredible
[GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) project, which publishes a public
archive of historical events to GitHub.

For example, to count the number of issues opened, closed, and reopened on 2020/01/01:

```sql
SELECT event as issue_status, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM (
  SELECT type, repo.name, actor.login,
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.action') as event,

Open Source Insights (aka [deps.dev](https://deps.dev/)) is a 
service developed and hosted by Google to help developers
better understand the structure, construction, and security
of open source software packages.
The service examines each package, constructs a full, detailed graph
of its dependencies and their properties, and makes the results available
to anyone who could benefit from them.
The goal is to provide developers with a picture of how their software is put together,
how that changes as dependencies change, and what the consequences might be.

For example, to determine which packages have the most dependents:

```sql
DECLARE
  Sys STRING DEFAULT 'CARGO';

SELECT
  Name,
  Version,
FROM (
  SELECT
    Name,
    Version,
    ROW_NUMBER()
      OVER (PARTITION BY
              Name
            ORDER BY
              VersionInfo.Ordinal DESC) AS RowNumber
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.deps_dev_v1.PackageVersionsLatest`
    WHERE
      System = Sys
      AND VersionInfo.IsRelease)
WHERE RowNumber = 1;
```

- Code License: [MIT](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl/blob/develop/LICENSE).

The Google Cloud team maintains a public
[Ethereum dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics).
This is backed by the [ethereum-etl](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl) project.

For example, to get 10 transactions from the latest block

```sql
SELECT
  `hash`,
  block_number,
  from_address,
  to_address,
  value,
  gas,
  gas_price
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` AS transactions

- Data on every OP Stack chain, maintained by [OP Labs PBC](https://www.oplabs.co/)
[code of conduct](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics?tab=coc-ov-file#readme)
- For more details on the ETL process please visit the [op-analytics](https://static.optimism.io/op-analytics) documentation site.
- Visit the Optimism docs to learn more about the [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer).

All tables are partitioned by date (`dt`) and clustered by chain name (`chain`). Data is updated daily with an approximate latency of 24 hrs.
Data is sourced from [Goldsky](https://docs.goldsky.com/introduction) using the [Mirror platform](https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror/introduction), which fetches and delivers onchain data from RPC nodes to ClickHouse.
From there, the OP Labs team runs an incremental ingestion process based on block number.

For example, to get all transactions to the 4337 EntryPoint contracts for all OP Stack chains:

```sql
  SELECT
    dt,
    chain,
    COUNT(*) AS txns
  FROM `optimism_superchain_raw_onchain_data.transactions`
  WHERE
    dt >= '2024-10-01'
    AND to_address IN (
      "0x5ff137d4b0fdcd49dca30c7cf57e578a026d2789",
      "0x0000000071727de22e5e9d8baf0edac6f37da032"
    )
  GROUP BY dt, chain
  ORDER BY dt, chain
```

### Superchain 4337

  }

The Superchain 4337 dataset provides comprehensive data about ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) activity across all OP Stack chains. This dataset is crucial for understanding the adoption and usage patterns of smart contract wallets, bundlers, and paymasters in the Superchain ecosystem. The data helps track which applications are leading the way in improving onchain UX through account abstraction.

All tables are partitioned by date (`dt`) and clustered by chain name (`chain`). The dataset includes decoded UserOps and Paymaster IDs to trace events from unique user smart contract wallet addresses to their wallet providers, paymasters, bundlers, and the applications they interact with.

For example, to see which paymasters are handling the most UserOperations across all chains:

```sql
SELECT
  chain,
  paymaster,
  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(userophash) AS user_ops
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.optimism_superchain_4337_account_abstraction_data.useroperationevent_logs_v2`
WHERE dt > '2025-02-01'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. We currently provide blocks, transactions, and traces for Arbitrum's flagship network, Arbitrum One. This public dataset is maintained by our partners at [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/).

For example, to get the average gas per transaction for each block on Arbitrum One on September 1st, 2024:

```sql
SELECT
  block_number,
  receipt_gas_used / 1 AS gas_per_txn
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.arbitrum_one.arbitrum_transactions`
WHERE block_timestamp BETWEEN 1693526400 AND 1693612800
ORDER BY block_number

[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a decentralized storage network designed to
store humanity's most important information.
This dataset mirrors the dataset offered by [Lily](https://lilium.sh/data/)
for use in the OSO data pipeline.
It includes storage deals, miners, FVM transactions, and much more.

For example, this is how to get how many messages were sent to the network in the last month:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_messages
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.filecoin_lily.parsed_messages`
WHERE
  CAST(timestamp_seconds((height * 30) + 1598306400) AS DATE) > CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH

[Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) is a decentralized social network built on Ethereum.
This dataset mirrors the dataset offered by [Indexing](https://blog.indexing.co/posts/IaPkkuevwwfgBWtZ3F7eg5oQUqyV_o6sLDo28oEV8Tg)
for use in the OSO data pipeline.
It includes casts, links, reactions, verifications, and profiles.

For example, to get the users with the most lifetime reactions:

```sql
SELECT
  r.target_cast_fid as fid,
  json_value(p.data, "$.display") as display_name,
  COUNT(*) as reaction_count
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.farcaster.reactions` as r
LEFT JOIN `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.farcaster.profiles` as p ON r.target_cast_fid = p.fid
GROUP BY fid, display_name
ORDER BY reaction_count DESC
```

Here's another use case, showing how to derive all the verified Ethereum addresses owned by a Farcaster user:

```sql
WITH
  profiles AS (
    SELECT
      v.fid,
      v.address,
      p.custody_address,
      JSON_VALUE(p.data, "$.username") AS username
    FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.farcaster.verifications` v
    JOIN `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.farcaster.profiles` p ON v.fid = p.fid
    WHERE v.deleted_at IS NULL
  ),
  eth_addresses AS (
    SELECT
      fid,
      username,
      address
    FROM profiles
    WHERE LENGTH(address) = 42
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      fid,
      username,
      custody_address AS address
    FROM profiles
  )
SELECT DISTINCT

in particular those that (a) operate on a graph,
(b) are iterative in nature and (c) have a tendency toward convergence.
Such algorithms include EigenTrust, Collaborative Filtering, Hubs and Authorities,
Latent Semantic Analysis, etc.

In this dataset, Farcaster users reputations are scored in 2 ways:
- With `globaltrust`, we calculate global reputation scores, seeded by the trust of Optimism badgeholders.
- With `localtrust`, you can get reputation scores of other users relative to specified user.

For example, you can get the globaltrust reputation score of **vitalik.eth**

```sql
SELECT
  strategy_id,
  i,
  v,
  date
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.karma3.globaltrust`
WHERE i = 5650
```

A standardized framework and data model for EVM address labeling, maintained by [growthepie.xyz](https://growthepie.xyz/).

For example, you can get project ownership labels for addresses:

```sql
SELECT
  address,
  chain_id,
  tag_value AS project_name
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.openlabelsinitiative.labels_decoded`
WHERE tag_id = 'owner_project'

[Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/) is an infrastructure public good for making attestations onchain or offchain about anything.

This dataset mirrors the dataset offered by [EAS](https://attest.org/) for use in the OSO data pipeline, currenty showing all attestations on the Optimism network.

For example, you can get a list of all * official * RetroPGF badgeholders:

```sql
SELECT
  recipient AS badgeholder,
  JSON_VALUE(decoded_data_json, "$[0].value.value") AS rpgfRound
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.ethereum_attestation_service_optimism.attestations`
WHERE
  revoked = False
  AND schema_id = '0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b'
  AND attester = '0x621477dBA416E12df7FF0d48E14c4D20DC85D7D9'
```

## Subscribe to a dataset

### 1. Data exchange listings

For datasets listed on the OSO public data exchange,
click on the "Subscribe on BigQuery" button to create a new
dataset that is linked to OSO.

![subscribe](./bigquery_subscribe.png)

This has a few benefits:

- Data is automatically kept live and real-time with OSO
- You keep a reference to the data in your own GCP project
- This gives OSO the ability to track public usage of models

### 2. Direct access to datasets

For datasets without a listing on the OSO public data exchange,
we make the dataset open to public queries for direct queries.
Click on the "View on BigQuery" button to go straight
to the dataset.

You can star the dataset to keep it in your project.

## Cost Estimation

BigQuery [on-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)
charges based on the number of bytes scanned,
with the first 1 TB free every month.

To keep track of your usage, check the bytes scanned in the top right corner before running your query.
