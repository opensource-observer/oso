title: Explore OSO data with Python

[`pyoso`](https://pypi.org/project/pyoso/) is the best way to explore OSO datasets.
Unlike the GraphQL API, which only has access to mart models,
`pyoso` allows you to query the full OSO data lake, including any intermediate models.

If you haven't set up `pyoso` yet, please refer to the
[getting started](../get-started/python.md)
guide to to setup your environment.

## Authentication

All requests to the OSO API must be authenticated.

### Generate an API key

First, go to [www.opensource.observer](https://www.opensource.observer) and create a new account.

If you already have an account, log in. Then create a new personal API key:

1. Go to [Account settings](https://www.opensource.observer/app/settings)
2. In the "API Keys" section, click "+ New"
3. Give your key a label - this is just for you, usually to describe a key's purpose.
4. You should see your brand new key. **Immediately** save this value, as you'll **never** see it again after refreshing the page.
5. Click "Create" to save the key.

**You can create as many keys as you like.**

### How to Authenticate

In order to authenticate with `pyoso`, you have to set
the `OSO_API_KEY` environment variable.

```python
os.environ["OSO_API_KEY"] = 'your_api_key'
```

You can also explicitly pass in your API key to the client

```python
from pyoso import Client
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)
```

## Exploring the data

Every stage of the OSO data pipeline can be queried from `pyoso`.
All model definitions can be found under
[`warehouse/oso_sqlmesh/models`](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso/tree/main/warehouse/oso_sqlmesh/models)
in our
[monorepo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso).

You can also view the [model lineage](https://dagster.opensource.observer/assets/sqlmesh?view=folder) in our
[Dagster dashboard](https://dagster.opensource.observer/).

### Model hierarchy

Generally speaking there are three types of models:

1. **Staging models and source data**:
   For each data source, staging models are created to clean and normalize
   the necessary subset of data.
2. **Intermediate models**:
   Here, we join all data sources into a master event table,
   [`int_events`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events).
   Then, we produce a series of aggregations such as
   [`int_events_daily_to_project`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events_daily_to_project)
3. **Mart models**:
   From the intermediate models, we create the final metric models.

:::warning
Our data pipeline is under heavy development and all table schemas are subject to change.
The most stable models will be versioned mart models.
We will monitor usage of mart models, both to ensure quality of service
and to deprecate models that are no longer used.

Please join us on [Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord) to stay up to date on updates.

### Example queries

Feel free to copy the `pyoso` 
[quickstart Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/pyoso-quickstart.ipynb)
to get started quickly.

For example, to plot Uniswap transactions on OP mainnet over time:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pyoso import Client

OSO_API_KEY = os.environ['OSO_API_KEY']
client = Client(api_key=OSO_API_KEY)
query = """
   SELECT 
      m.metric_name as metric_name,
      tm.sample_date as date,
      tm.amount as amount
   FROM timeseries_metrics_by_project_v0 AS tm
   JOIN metrics_v0 AS m ON tm.metric_id = m.metric_id
   JOIN projects_v1 AS p ON tm.project_id = p.project_id
   WHERE p.project_name = 'uniswap'
   ORDER BY tm.sample_date DESC
"""
df = client.to_pandas(query)
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
(df.query("metric_name == 'OPTIMISM_transactions_daily'").plot(kind='line', x='date', y='amount'))
```


## Performance/Cost optimization

Typically, downstream models are typically smaller
than upstream models, like source data.
So, it is generally recommended to use the model
that is further downstream in the lineage graph
that can satisfy your query.
Each stage of the pipeline typically reduces the size of the data
by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

If there is an intermediate model addition
(such as a new event type or aggregation)
that you think could help save costs for others in the future,
please consider contributing to our
[data models](../contribute-models/sqlmesh).

## Rate Limits

All requests are rate limited. There are currently 2 separate rate limit tiers:

- Anyone can make a query, subject to a standard rate limit.
- Developers who have been accepted into the [Kariba Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network) will be subject to a higher rate limit.

:::warning
We are still currently adjusting our rate limits based on capacity and demand. If you feel like your rate limit is too low, please reach out to us on our [Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord).
