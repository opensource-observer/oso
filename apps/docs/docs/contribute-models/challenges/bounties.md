:::info
The aim of our bounty program is to encourage and reward the community for contributing to the growth and experimentation on OSO. Bounties are only available to members of the [Kariba Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network).

## Competitive Bounties

Occassionally we post data science bounties and run community competitions. Each bounty has a set of requirements and a reward.
See our list of [Data Challenges](./) or historical bounties on
[Bountycaster](https://www.bountycaster.xyz/fid/19412).

The best way to learn about new data bounties is to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSObserver) or join our [Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord).

## Ongoing Bounties

We also have a number of ongoing bounties for contributing to the oss-directory. These bounties are available to all members of the Data Collective and are paid out in USD.

:::note
Please reach out to one of the maintainers for guidance on what projects and ecosystems we're currently looking for help with. We don't want to waste your time on projects that are already well-covered or that we don't have the capacity to review.

### Adding a New Project

> ðŸ’° 1.00 USD per new project successfully added to the OSS Directory.
