:::info
This guide is for an in-depth understanding of our model generation
factory that is used to generate the time series metrics for OSO. If you'd like
a more practical example of how to add new time series metrics models, [go
here](./data-models.md).
:::

## Background

The creation of the time series metrics factory requires some deeper knowledge
about sqlmesh and sqlglot. Much of this information is available in the
documentation for sqlmesh and sqlglot but the combined utility is not readily
documented. This section covers an overview of prerequisite knowledge:

### SQLMesh Python Models

The timeseries metrics generation take advantage of the fact that sqlmesh allows
for python models as well as sql models. A python model in sqlmesh looks
something like this:

```python
import typing as t
from datetime import datetime

from sqlmesh import ExecutionContext, model

@model(
    "my_model.name",
    columns={
        "column_name": "int",
    },
)
def execute(
    context: ExecutionContext,
    start: datetime,
    end: datetime,
    execution_time: datetime,
    **kwargs: t.Any,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...
```

According to the sqlmesh documentation, Python models come in two different
forms:

1. A model that returns a dataframe (e.g. pandas, pyspark, snowpark)
2. A model that returns a sqlglot expression (`sqlglot.exp.Expression`)

These models are discovered by sqlmesh's loader as long as the model exists in
the `models` directory of a sqlmesh project.

### Python Models and Factory Functions

Since python models are simply python code the sqlmesh loader will simply
execute any python modules in the `models` directory. This then allows for a
factory pattern with regards to sqlmesh python models. This is a basic example:

```python
def model_factory(values: list[str]):
    @model(
        f"my_model.{values}_model",
        columns={
            "column_name": "int",
        },
    )
    def execute(
        context: ExecutionContext,
        start: datetime,
        end: datetime,
        execution_time: datetime,
        **kwargs: t.Any,
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        ...

```

In this example, the factory takes an input of `values` which is just a list of
strings. If Used like this:

```python
# Instantiate the factory
model_factory(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
```

We would then generate `my_model.foo_model`, `my_model.bar_model`, and
`my_model.baz_model`.

This contrived example isn't all that useful but if you can imagine that the
`values` parameter could be derived in any way that python allows, it opens up
possibilities. On it's own this might not seem useful but this pattern is the
building block of the time series metrics factory.

### SQLGlot Rewriting

With the timeseries metrics factory we take advantage of the fact that sqlglot
can handle semantic rewriting to do some fairly powerful transformations for
when generating metrics models. Take for example the following sql:

```python
SELECT e.id as id, e.name as name FROM employees as e
```

When parsed by SQLGlot using `sqlglot.parse_one` we get the following AST.

```python
Select(
  expressions=[
    Alias(
      this=Column(
        this=Identifier(this=id, quoted=False),
        table=Identifier(this=e, quoted=False)),
      alias=Identifier(this=id, quoted=False)),
    Alias(
      this=Column(
        this=Identifier(this=name, quoted=False),
        table=Identifier(this=e, quoted=False)),
      alias=Identifier(this=name, quoted=False))],
  from=From(
    this=Table(
      this=Identifier(this=employees, quoted=False),
      alias=TableAlias(
        this=Identifier(this=e, quoted=False)))))
```

Given this object representation, we can actually use sqlglot to rewrite the
source_table to point to an entirely different source table. If we wished to
instead use `updated_employees` as the source table that's something we can do
like this:

```python
from sqlglot import parse_one, exp

query = parse_one("SELECT e.id as id, e.name as name FROM employees as e")
updated_table_name_query = exp.replace_tables(query, {"employees": "updated_employees"})
```

More interestingly, let's say we wanted to use the `employees` but instead of
getting just the `id` of a given employee in the `source_table` we also want to
get the department name by joining on the departments table. Let's pretend that
the employees table also has `department_id` as an available column.

We could do this transform as follows:

```python
# The top level expression is a `sqlglot.exp.Select` expression.
# This has the columns in the `expressions` property. Ideally,
# we'd actually want to wrap this in a function that doesn't update
# this in place so we can preserve the original query, but for simplicity
# we simply do this for now.
query.expressions.append(exp.to_column("d.department_name").as_("department_name"))

# To add the join we simply add it to the parsed object.
# Notice we need to have query on the left side of the equal sign.
# This is because the `join()` method does not update the original
# object in place.
query = query.join(
    exp.to_table("departments").as_("d"),
    on="d.department_id = e.department_id",
    join_type="inner"
)
```

And this would generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  e.id AS id,
  e.name AS name,
  d.department_name AS department_name
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN departments AS d
  ON d.department_id = e.department_id
```

## The Time Series Metrics Factory

The time series metrics factory is a factory function that generates a
collection of models based on a configuration that effectively parameterizes any
query that performs some kind of aggregation. The parameterizations, at this
time, are limited to different entity relationships or time aggregations (either
normal time buckets or rolling windows). Combined, this allows us to generate a
large number of models from a single query definition. Additionally, the
generated models are combined in various ways to provide additional metadata for
the OSO frontend.

We implemented this models metrics factory as a way to keep the data warehouse
as DRY as possible. More code means more maintenance and given the power
available in sqlmesh and sqlglot to enable semantic transformations, we would
reduce lines of code significantly.

### Key Components

The following Entity Relationship diagram gives a general overview of the architecture of the time series metrics factory:

The key components of the diagram are:

- `TimeseriesMetrics (Factory)`
  - This is the factory class that is defined in
    `warehouse/metrics_tools/factory/factory.py`. This should generally be
    instantiated from sqlmesh using the `timeseries_metrics` function.
- `MetricQuery`
  - This is used to define any parameters that should associated with a given
    metric. This needs a reference to a metrics sql query from
    `warehouse/oso_sqlmesh/oso_metrics`. This is defined by the
    `MetricQueryDef` object when instantiating a `TimeseriesMetrics` class.
- `MetricModelDefinition`
  - This object defines a single metric model that the factory generates. It
    is all the parameters specific to that single model and includes any
    rendered sql that is used to execute the model's query.
- `Time series custom macros`
  - These are special macro functions that are injected into each of the
    models for things like proper time boundaries and sample dates.
- `MacroOverridingModel`
  - This is a special class we created to override the macros of the generated
    sqlmesh models.

### Rendering SQL for each metric model

The majority of the interesting parts of the metrics factory happen inside the
rendering of each of the metric models.

Each of the metrics models has a set of parameters. For example, given the
following `MetricsQueryDef`:

```python
    "stars": MetricQueryDef(
        ref="code/stars.sql",
        time_aggregations=[
            "daily",
            "weekly",
        ],
        entity_types=["artifact", "project"],
    ),
```

You'd end up with 4 different metrics models:

- Entity Type = `artifact`
  - Time Aggregation = `daily`
  - Time Aggregation = `weekly`
- Entity Type = `project`
  - Time Aggregation = `daily`
  - Time Aggregation = `weekly`

We then iterate through each of these different parameters and generate the
associated sql for each of these models. We use a special joining transformation
that is defined in `warehouse/metrics_tools/joiner` to handle the entity type
parameters and the injected macros for each of the models handles the proper
time bucketing by utilizing a `@time_aggregation` that is injected to the
model's sqlmesh context.

### A note on SQLMesh's customized python function serialization

This is not something you will find much documentation on in the official
sqlmesh docs but sqlmesh's state system is powerful because it has the ability
to track changes to both sql and python models. Part of how it achieves this is
that it stores python models in a special serialized format. This also means
that it can use the serialized python to perform it's "runs" of any given
sqlmesh model in a way that is properly versioned (for the most part).

For our purposes, we actually try to use what we call `proxies` (see
`warehouse/metrics_tools/factory/proxy`) because the sqlmesh storing the
serialized python is a bit too sensitive to change. This might not always be
what we want in the future as changes in the code could should likely cause
changes in the model but this was done because many of the generated metrics
models rely on the same code so changing a one small thing could cause breaking
changes. In the future we might avoid this by simply setting all metrics models
to be forward only (this is now the default setting).
