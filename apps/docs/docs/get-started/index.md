[Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer)
is a community effort for measuring the impact of open source software.
Our data and models evolve with the community in a way that is
[open source, open data, open infrastructure](../../blog/open-source-open-data-open-infra).

There are 3 easy ways of accessing OSO datasets:

- For exploratory analysis and data science in Python, check out [pyoso](./python.md).
- For live integrations in a production application, you'll want [API access](./api.mdx).
- For direct access to the data warehouse, you can setup [BigQuery](./bigquery.mdx).

If you think you'll be an ongoing contributor to OSO,
please apply to join the [Kariba Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network).
