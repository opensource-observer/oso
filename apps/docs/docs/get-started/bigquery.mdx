OSO's data lake is currently located in BigQuery on Google Cloud (GCP).
Every data model is made publicly available by a BigQuery dataset.

This page will guide you through the process of subscribing to the OSO production dataset and making your first query.

## Sign up for Google Cloud

Navigate to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and log in.
If this is your first time here, you can sign up for a free cloud account
using your existing Google account.
If you already have a GCP account,
[skip to the dataset](#subscribe-to-the-oso-production-dataset).

![GCP Signup](./gcp_signup.png)

First, select a country and agree to the terms of service.
Then, you need to enter your payment information for verification
and answer a few marketing questions.

:::tip
GCP offers a free tier that includes $300 in credits. After that, it is easy to stay in the free tier provided you remain under the
1TB per month limit for BigQuery data processed.

Finally, you will be brought to the admin console where you can create a new project.
Feel free to name this GCP project anything you'd like.
(Or you can simply leave the default project name 'My First Project'.)

_Note: you won't be able to create a new project if you're not an administrator of your Google organization_

## Subscribe to the OSO production dataset

Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
Navigate to **BigQuery** from the left-hand menu and
then click on **BigQuery Studio** from the hover menu.

![GCP Admin](./gcp_admin.png)

The console features an **Explorer** frame on the left-hand side,
which lists all the datasets available to you,
and a **Studio Console** which has tabs for organizing your work.
This will be your workspace for querying the OSO dataset.

![GCP Welcome](./gcp_welcome.png)

Click on the following link to subscribe to the OSO production dataset:

<Button
  size={"compact"}
  color={"blue"}

  }
  children={"Subscribe on BigQuery"}
/>

Create a linked dataset in your own GCP project.

## Make your first query

Open a new tab by clicking on the `+` icon
on the top right of the console to `Create SQL Query`.

From here you will be able to write any SQL you'd like any OSO dataset.
For example, you can query the `oso_production` dataset for
all available collections like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.collections_v1`
```

**Remember to update the project name in the query.**

Click **Run** to execute your query.
The results will appear in a table at the bottom of the console.

The console will help you complete your query as you type, and will also provide you with a preview of the results and computation time. You can save your queries, download the results, and even make simple visualizations directly from the console.

:::tip
To explore all the OSO datasets available, see the 
[Data Overview](../integrate/datasets/index.mdx).

- **oso_production** contains all production data. This can be quite large depending on the dataset.
- **oso_playground** contains only the last 2 weeks for every dataset. We recommend using this for development and testing.

## Next steps

Now that you're set up, there are many ways to contribute to OSO and integrate the data with your application:

- [SQL Query Guide](../integrate/query-data.mdx) for more details on running effective queries
- [Write Python notebooks](../guides/notebooks/index.mdx) for advanced analysis and visualizations
- [Propose an impact model](../contribute-models/data-models.md) to run in the OSO data pipeline
- [Query the OSO API](../integrate/api.md) for impact metrics and project info to integrate into your application
