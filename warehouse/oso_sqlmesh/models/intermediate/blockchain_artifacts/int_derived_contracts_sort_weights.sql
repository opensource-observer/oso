-- In order to keep this model as small and the least complicated it can be we
-- take the last 180 days and aggregate activity on a given contract on a weekly
-- basis when used in the contracts overview model. This model is intermediate
-- to that model and simply aggregates the transactions on a weekly basis for a
-- given contract. It only goes back ~6 months from the time we deployed this
-- model (2025-02-01)

-- In the future we should make a different model type for this that
-- automatically deletes _old_ data that we don't need. However sqlmesh doesn't
-- have out of the box support for that yet so we will implement as an
-- INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE model for now.
