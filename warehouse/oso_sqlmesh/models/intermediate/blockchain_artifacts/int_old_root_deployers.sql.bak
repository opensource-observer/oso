-- Root deployers is an interesting problem. When a contract gets created we
-- don't know if it's a factory based on our current processing. We can only
-- know that a contract is a factory if it has deployed other contracts. This
-- model is an attempt to identify the root deployer of a contract. The root
-- deployer is discovered by looking backwards through contract creators. To
-- prevent our warehouse from storing far too much data we only look back 365
-- days and incrementally update this model. If the contract is used as a
-- factory within that time and was also deployed within that time a row will be
-- created in this model.
