/* 
Root deployers is an interesting problem. When a contract gets created we don't
know if it's a factory based on our current processing. We can only currently
know that a contract is a factory if it has deployed other contracts. This model
is an attempt to identify the root deployer of a contract. The root deployer is
discovered by looking backwards through contract creators. To prevent our
warehouse from storing far too much data we only look back 365 days and
incrementally update this model. If the contract is used as a factory within
that time and was also deployed within that time a row will be created in this
model. 

By the nature of our search, the root deployer is a best effort and may not
always be accurate.
