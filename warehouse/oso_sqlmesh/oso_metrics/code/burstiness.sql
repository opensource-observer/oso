-- Calculate Fano Factor (variance²/mean) as a measure of burstiness for repository activity
-- Since the rows are not zero-filled, we need to calculate using manual formulas instead 
-- of using built in VAR_POP and AVG functions.
-- Breakdown of formulas:
-- Average = SUM/COUNT
-- VAR_POP = Σ((amount-mean)²)/COUNT
--         = Σ(amount² - 2*amount*mean + mean²)/COUNT
--         = Σ(amount²)/COUNT - Σ(2*amount*mean)/COUNT + Σ(mean²)/COUNT
--         = Σ(amount²)/COUNT - -2*mean * Σ(amount)/COUNT + COUNT * mean² / COUNT
--         = Σ(amount²)/COUNT - 2*mean² + mean²
--         = Σ(amount²)/COUNT - mean²
