# pyoso

_WARNING: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS_

`pyoso` is a Python package for fetching models and metrics from OSO. This package provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with oso and retrieve valuable data for analysis and monitoring.

## Features

- Execute custom SQL queries for analyzing the OSO dataset.
- Inspect data dependencies and freshness with an analytics tree.
- Semantic modeling layer to build and execute complex queries (optional).

## Installation

You can install `pyoso` using pip:

```bash
pip install pyoso
```

### Optional Semantic Modeling

For semantic modeling capabilities, you can install with the semantic extra:

```bash
pip install pyoso[semantic]
```

This will include the `oso_semantic` package for building semantic models and queries.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use `pyoso` to fetch data directly into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import os
from pyoso import Client

# Initialize the client with an API key
os.environ["OSO_API_KEY"] = 'your_api_key'
client = Client()

# Fetch artifacts
query = "SELECT * FROM artifacts_v1 LIMIT 5"
artifacts = client.to_pandas(query)

print(artifacts)
```

### Inspecting Data Dependencies

For more advanced use cases, the `client.query()` method returns a `QueryResponse` object that contains both the data and analytics metadata. This allows you to inspect the dependency tree of the data sources used in your query.

```python
import os
from pyoso import Client

# Initialize the client
os.environ["OSO_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
client = Client()

# Execute a query to get a QueryResponse object
query = "SELECT * FROM artifacts_v1 LIMIT 5"
response = client.query(query)

# You can still get the DataFrame as before
df = response.to_pandas()
print("\n--- Query Data ---")
print(df)

# Now, inspect the analytics to see the dependency tree
print("\n--- Data Dependency Tree ---")
response.analytics.print_tree()
```

This will output a tree structure showing how the final `artifacts_v1` table was constructed from its upstream dependencies, helping you understand the data's origin and freshness.

## Using in notebooks

pyoso also has special support for notebooks. Specifically, we provide a helper function to create a database connection to the OSO dataset that can be used with `marimo`. To use this, we suggest you make a cell at the start of your notebook with the following code:

```python
from pyoso.notebook import marimo_db
pyoso_db_conn = marimo_db()
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation about the OSO dataset, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/integrate/datasets/).

## Future Plans

- Create DataFrame wrapper for creating SQL query from data transforms

## Manually testing with pyodide

We need to add pyodide to CI, but for now to manually run tests do the following:

### Get current pyodide version

You will need to do this from the pyoso directory.

```bash
PYODIDE_EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION=$(pyodide config get emscripten_version)
```

### Install emscripten

Choose a place to store the code and git clone `emsdk`:

```bash
cd some/base/directory
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk
cd emsdk

./emsdk install ${PYODIDE_EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION}
./emsdk activate ${PYODIDE_EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION}
source emsdk_env.sh
```

### Build pyodide wheel

Now go back to the `pyoso` directory

```bash
cd oso/warehouse/pyoso
uv run pyodide build
```

This will generate a `.whl` file in `dist`

### Download pyodide version

Download the recent pyodide version (at the time of writing is 0.27.2):

```bash
cd dist/
wget https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/download/0.27.2/pyodide-0.27.2.tar.bz2
tar xjf pyodide-0.27.2.tar.bz2
```

This will now have generated a `dist/pyodide` directory.

### Run pytest

```bash
uv run pytest --run-in-pyodide . --runtime node --dist-dir=./dist
```
