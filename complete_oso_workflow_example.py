Complete example demonstrating OSO MCP server usage for Optimism collection analysis.

This script shows the full workflow described in .github/instructions:
1. Define pyoso client with OSO_API_KEY
2. Use query_text2sql_agent (simulated MCP tool call)
3. Run SQL query via pyoso client
4. Analyze results
